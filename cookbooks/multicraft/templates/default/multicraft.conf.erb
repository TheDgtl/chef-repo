[multicraft]
## The daemon will run under this user (not used for Windows)
user = <%= @user %>:<%= @group %>
## Directories created by Multicraft will have the owner set to
## the user and the group set to the webUser (not used for Windows)
## default: same as "user"
# webUser = www-data:www-data

## The daemon will listen on the following IP/port.
## 0.0.0.0 to listen on all available interfaces (all IPs). Note that
## you will have to use the "externalIp" setting below if you set this
## to 0.0.0.0 as the control panel needs to know where to connect.
ip = <%= @daemon_listen_ip %>
port = <%= @daemon_listen_port %>

## If the external address is different from the listen address
## you can set the external address here. This setting will be saved
## to the DB and used by the control panel to connect to the daemon.
## default: same as "ip"
externalIp = <%= @daemon_external_ip %>

## The connection password for daemon communication
## !! Change this when you set Multicraft to listen on a public IP !!
## The same password will have to be put in the panels "daemon.php"
password = <%= @daemon_password %>

## The daemon ID. Only used for reseller edition to assign servers to daemons
## Running multiple servers with the same IDs can cause unpredictable behavior
## Valid values: 1, 2, ..., 10
id = <%= @daemon_id %>

## The database containing daemon 
## default: sqlite:data.db (-> "baseDir"/"dataDir"/data.db)
#database = sqlite:data.db
## Example for MySQL connections:
database = mysql:host=<%= @sql_host %>;dbname=<%= @sql_database %>
dbUser = <%= @sql_user %>
dbPassword = <%= @sql_password %>
#dbCharset = utf8

## A name for this daemon, this is optional
## default: Multicraft Daemon
name = <%= @daemon_name %>

## The amount of memory available to this daemon. This setting mainly
## serves informational purpose for display in the control panel and
## for the API to decide if this daemon can still run more servers.
## 0 means undefined
## default: 0
totalMemory = <%= @max_memory %>

## The base directory of the multicraft install. Relative to the users
## home directory or absolute. Must exist.
## default: multicraft (-> /home/"user"/multicraft)
baseDir = <%= @home %>
## The directory the daemon binaries reside in
## default: bin (-> "baseDir"/bin)
daemonDir = bin
## The data directory. Contains the database, socket, log and
## must be accessible by the control panel user if using a SQLite DB
## default: data (-> "baseDir"/data)
dataDir = data
## The directory jar files can be placed in
## default: jar (-> "baseDir"/jar)
jarDir = jar
## The directory containing all the servers. Users can be given access
## to specific subdirectories containing their server data
## default: servers (-> "baseDir"/servers)
serversDir = servers
## The following files contain daemon specific data.
## The paths specified are relative to "baseDir"
pidFile = multicraft.pid
logFile = multicraft.log
licenseFile = multicraft.key
scriptsFile = scripts.conf

## Note that for all of the above settings where a file or directory is
## indicated you can also use absolute paths (/dir), home-relative
## paths (~/dir) or relative paths (./dir or ../dir). "dir" stands for
## the setting you're editing.
## When not using absolute/relative paths the setting is taken to be
## relative to the home directory of the user configured by the "user"
## setting.
## Examples:
## - Changing "baseDir" to ./multicraft will cause multicraft to search
##   all the files in a subdirectory "multicraft" of the directory it's
##   called from
## - Changing "logFile" to ~/multicraft.log will cause Multicraft to log
##   everything to the file multicraft.log in the home directory of the
##   user configured by the "user" setting

## The maximum size of one logfile after which the log will be rotated
## default: 20971520 (20 MB)
logSize = <%= @daemon_log_size %>

## The number of log files to keep (multicraft.log.1 ... multicraft.log.X)
## default: 9
logCount = 9

## Synchronize log writes. Disabling this will improve performance at the
## risk of having some log entries overlap.
## default: true
#logSync = false

## Use thesyslog facility instead of logging to a file.
## default: false
#logSyslog = true

## The syslog facility to log to. Possible values: auth, cron, daemon,
## kern, lpr, mail, news, security, syslog, user, uucp, local10-17
## default: daemon
#logFacility = daemon

## Delay between server auto-starts in milliseconds.
## default: 750
autostartDelay = 750

## Integrated FTP server settings
[ftp]
## Wheter or not to enable the integrated FTP server, true/false
## default: true
enabled = <%= @ftp_enabled %>
## IP to listen on for FTP connections, uncomment to use the same as
## for the daemon.
## 0.0.0.0 means listening on all available interfaces (all IPs)
## default: same as the "ip" setting for the daemon, see above
#ftpIp = 0.0.0.0
## See the descriptions of "externalIp" and "ip" for the daemon above
## default: same as "externalIp" if "ftpIp" is "0.0.0.0" otherwise "ftpIp"
#ftpExternalIp = 
## Masquerade IP address to use for passive FTP connections when
## Multicraft is running behind a router.
## default: empty
#ftpNatIp = 
## A port range to use for passive data transfers. If this is not
## specified the FTP server will use random ports.
## Format: 4000-8000
## default: empty
#ftpPasvPorts = 
## Port to listen on for incoming FTP connections. Change this to
## something else if you are already running an FTP server on this
## system.
## default: 21
ftpPort = <%= @ftp_port %>
## Regular expression matching files that can't be manipulated by
## users in any way. If you want users to be able to upload their own
## plugins instead of using the ones you provide for them you can
## just comment this option out.
## default: empty
forbiddenFiles = <%= @ftp_forbidden %>

## Minecraft default settings
[minecraft]
## The default amount of reserved memory
## default: 1024
memory = 1024
## The name of the java executable

## directory as configured above

## - {SERVER_DIR} The directory of the server (working directory)
## - {MULTICRAFT_DIR} The Multicraft base directory ("baseDir" above)
## - {BASE_DIR} The directory containing all the servers ("serversDir above")

command = zip -qr "{WORLD}-tmp.zip" "{WORLD}"*/
## The same setting for Windows systems
commandWin = "{MULTICRAFT_DIR}\bin\zip.exe" -qr "{WORLD}-tmp.zip" "{WORLD}"*/

## System settings

## The script that is run just before calling the Minecraft server.
## Prepares the process and the server files.
prepareScript = scripts/prepare.sh

## Whether or not to use one system user per Minecraft server.
## This is recommended if you let your users upload untrusted executables.
## Note that for every server a new system user is automatically created
## if this option is enabled (user name format and commands configured below).
## default: false
#multiuser = true

## Display the output of this command in the panel under
## "Settings"->"Multicraft Status"
## default: empty
